# ⚙️ Step Decomposition  

1. Look for input pattern in the output
2. Output is divided into 9 tiles, each 3x3 one exactly the same as the input.

| 1    | `record_pattern`    | capture the input pattern and keep it in your memory     |
| 2    | `divide_to_tiles`   | split the output grid into 3x3 tiles                     |
| 3    | `replicate_pattern` | repeat the input pattern in the 3x3 tiles                |
| 4    | `tile_patteren`     | replicate the same pattern like tiles in the output grid |
