# ⚙️ Step Decomposition  

1. Look for input pattern in the output
2. Output is divided into 9 tiles, each 3x3 one exactly the same as the input.

| Step | Transformation Tag  | Description                                                                                     |
| ---- | ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | `detect_background` | identify the color that fills the largest continuous area or surrounds other shapes in the grid |
| 2    | `record_pattern`    | capture the input pattern and keep it in your memory                                            |
| 3    | `divide_to_tiles`   | split the output grid into 3x3 tiles                                                            |
| 4    | `replicate_pattern` | repeat the input pattern in the 3x3 tiles                                                       |
| 5    | `tile_patteren`     | replicate the same pattern like tiles in the output grid                                        |
